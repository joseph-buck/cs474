        "\n",
        "___\n",
        "\n",
        "### Grading\n",
        "Your notebook will be graded on the following:\n",
        "* 50% Part 1: Completed the 10 PyTorch microtasks\n",
        "* 40% Part 2: Image indicating TensorFlow success\n",

        "\n",
        "Colab provides an environment that interacts with IPython notebooks (similar to Jupyter) and utilizes a standardized Python distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "While you are allowed to do the labs on your own machine, using Jupyter or some other IPython notebook editor, the labs were written and updated for the current Python distribution used by Colab. You may need to do extra troubleshooting to get them working locally. Also, setting up your own GPU for deep learning may be difficult, and training on the CPU may be unbearably slow in later labs.\n",

        "2.    Display an image that you generate using the Tensorflow playground\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 1, you will be using the PyTorch documentation to learn how to complete simple tasks. Each task is solvable in one or two lines of code. Links are provided for each microtask to give you a guided introduction to PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 2, you should visit the [TensorFlow playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/),\n",
        "and play with different settings. Most of it will be unfamiliar,\n",
        "but don't worry – you can't break it!\n",
        "Once you have a working classifier on the spiral dataset, take a screenshot. \n",
